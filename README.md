# Imp
Simple, customizable blogging

## What is Imp?
Imp is a tool for generating beautiful blogs.  

It's very opinionated about design.

That's not to say you can't customize Imp sites: the entirety of the sites styling is summarized in `style.css` and `article.css`.

## .imp
The core file of an Imp site is `.imp`. It's a very simple format:
```imp
First line = title
Second line = subtitle
Third line = background image

# Rich markdown text
here.
```

## Quickstart
First, clone this repository. Then, proceed.
### config.json
Change the values in `config.json` to match your blog.
```json
{
    "name": "Imp",
    "tagline": "Simple blogging",
    "cta": ["Learn more", "#"],
    "nav": [],
    "icon": "../assets/icon.svg"
}
```
The `cta` field defines the call to action link that will be in the hero section of your home page.  
The `nav` field can remain as is. If you want to define the order in which your categories (directories) appear in your top nav, you can define that there.
### raws/
The only other place you have to touch to get started is the `raws/` directory. Under `raws/`, add a directory. The name of this directory should be the name of a category of your blog. For example, you might create a directory `raws/Desserts` if you were working on a recipe website.

Under this inner directory, add a file ending in `.featured.imp`. The pre-suffix name of this file isn't important.

Fill the file with as explained above in the `.imp` section.

The `.featured` in the file extension tells Imp that this is the featured article for a category. Every category must have a featured article.
### Fonts
Imp ships with default font Arial, but you can modify that in `style.css`.
### Compile
Then, push your repository to GitHub. The actions workflow under `.github/` should compile the raws into their correct HTML format.  

If you don't use GitHub or you want to preview before pushing, install `requirements.txt` with pip and run `python compile.py`.
