                <sub>A fresh start.</sub>
                <p>Welcome to my blog! It's a little sparse at the moment, but there's lots of good coming!  </p>

<p>I'll be writing about the latest tech (if it's interesting), maybe some hardware, and maybe just some life things.  </p>

<p>I've written competitively for quite a few years now - I've won a good bit too - but I'm kind of tired of writing about politics and whatnot. I want to write random sh*t, unfiltered and just as opinionated, but less... heavy.  </p>

<p>So there's definitely new things coming, and I hope you stay along for the journey!  </p>

<p>In the meantime, you can check out some of my writing on <a href="https://hwalgi.org">Hwalgi</a> or look at my portfolio at <a href="https://rockwill.dev">rockwill.dev</a>!</p>
