Who Am I?

A brief introduction.

My name is William Choi-Kim, and I’m a tech enthusiast and occasional programmer. I love tech, but more than that, I love *using* tech. I do art and make music, so fusing technology with these things is my jam.

I bring a new perspective to reviews and news - I’ve written for years on politics and society, so I see a different side to things. Maybe you like that! If you do, stick along; I promise you won’t be disappointed.
